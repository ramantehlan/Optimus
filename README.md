# Optimus
This is the project which I create for **AbinBev Hackathon Feb-2017**. It is a web app which is home to a powerful Artificial Intelligence(AI), named as Optimus. which help business visualise their data sets and get better insights into the factors which are driving sales.

This app allows all the retailer's or shop owners to upload their monthly or weekly sales data (as a CSV or Excel file) and then by machine learning it create a database automatically. Once the database is ready, it visualises all the data sets in the form charts and graphs, also it analyses all the data sets to tell you about important insights below every visualisation. Those important insights include `When to advertise for more sales`, `When to give offers to customers`, `Which product to produce more`,  `which product needs attention` etc.

This app also provides you with random facts about your industry.
